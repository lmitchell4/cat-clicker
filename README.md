# Cat Clicker

This is a site that keeps track of how many times you've clicked on a picture of a cat.  I'm in the process of refactoring it to use a Model-View-Controller layout. 

To run it, fork the repo and open the file `index.html` in your browser of choice, select a cat from the list on the left, and start clicking on the picture of that cat that comes up.
